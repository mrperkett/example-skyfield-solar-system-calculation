An example using the [`skyfield`](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield/) module to calculate and plot each planet's distance from the Sun and from the Earth.  My calculation uses the `de438t.bsp` spicekernel, which covers a time span from 1549-DEC-21 to 2650-JAN-25.

My initial motivation for this calculation came from a web article titled [Venus is not Earthâ€™s closest neighbor](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190312a/full/).  It makes a big deal about the different between an *average* distance and a *closest approach* distance.  Although not as revolutionary of a concept as the article makes it out to be, it does provide a fun test of `skyfield`'s functionality.

It's interesting to note that Earth is closer to the Sun on average than any of the planets.
